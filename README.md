# Introduction on Ecotron Software Toolchain: EcoCoder-AI
EcoCoder-AI is a powerful automatic code generation MATLAB/Simulink library that links directly to the target controller. The highlighted features of EcoCoder-AI include code generation, compilation and one-click generation of executable files.

With EcoCoder-AI, the Simulink model-based control strategy can be directly converted into a ROS-based executable program for the target controller and downloaded to the target controller. It helps developers make most use out of Simulink's generic libraries, which makes it extremely easy for application developers to use model-based programming method to develop ROS-based applications.
