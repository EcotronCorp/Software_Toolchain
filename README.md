# Introduction on Ecotron Software Toolchain

## EcoCoder-AI
EcoCoder-AI is a powerful automatic code generation MATLAB/Simulink library that links directly to the target controller. The highlighted features of EcoCoder-AI include code generation, compilation and one-click generation of executable files.

With EcoCoder-AI, the Simulink model-based control strategy can be directly converted into a ROS-based executable program for the target controller and downloaded to the target controller. It helps developers make most use out of Simulink's generic libraries, which makes it extremely easy for application developers to use model-based programming method to develop ROS-based applications.

## EcoFlash

EcoFlash is a code flashing software. The function of the software is to flash the compiled executable code into the low-level device and start the device to execute the program to achieve software code flashing and online upgrade.

## EcoCAL
EcoCAL is the calibration software of EV/Hybrid system from Ecotron, which can be used to connect and control the battery/motor states, modify the maps of the driver torque, verify the threshold of the acceleration/brake pedals, control the auxiliaries etc.
Ecotron HCU/VCU is fully programmable, so if you want to change the setting of VCU/HCU, you need to connect HCU/VCU to laptop via EcoCAL.
